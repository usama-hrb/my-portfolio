Social Media Links: Connects to social profiles for networking.

Files

index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the portfolio.
style.css: The CSS file defining the styling, layout, and interactive effects.

Technologies Used

HTML5: For semantic structure and content organization.
CSS3: For styling, including flexbox for layout, custom scrollbars, and hover transitions.
Fonts: Uses the "Inter" font family from Google Fonts for typography.

Setup Instructions

Clone or Download: Download the project files or clone the repository.
Open index.html: Place both index.html and style.css in the same directory, then open index.html in a web browser.
Optional Enhancements:
Add JavaScript for theme toggling or email copy functionality.
Host on a web server (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) for online access.



Usage

Navigate through the portfolio using the header links (Home, About, Projects).
Click "Hire Me" to initiate contact or copy the email for communication.
Explore projects to view descriptions of Minishell, IRC Server, Wolfenstein 3D, and Inception.
Use social media icons to connect with Oussama on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, or GitHub.

Notes

The website currently lacks JavaScript for dynamic features like theme switching or email copying. These can be added by implementing additional scripts.
Images (e.g., profile, project placeholders, social media icons) are referenced but not included; replace placeholders with actual images for full functionality.
The design is optimized for accessibility and smooth scrolling, with custom scrollbars styled for a polished look.
